; The guile-2.2 par-for-each implementation sucks, and live-locks
; for more than about 4-5 threads, and sometimes with less.
; The guile 2.9.4 par-for-each implemetation is mostly not insane;
; however, it appears to offer no speedup whatsoever over
; single-threaded operation ... for MI computations. (It does offer
; perfect 24x speedup on 24 cores for pattern matching... its unclear
; why it fails to speed up MI computations.)  Disable for now, since
; none of the matrix code benefits from this.
; XXX TODO diganose the root cause and report back to guile devels.
