  add-similarity-compute LLOBJ - Extend LLOBJ with methods to compute
  vector dot-products, cosine angles and jaccard distances between two
  rows or columns of the LLOBJ sparse matrix.

  Some terminology: Let N(x,y) be the observed count for the pair (x,y).
  There are two ways of computing a dot-product: summing on the left,
  to get a dot-product of columns, or summing on the right, to get a
  product of rows.  Thus we define the left-product as
      left-prod(y,z) = sum_x N(x,y) N(x,z)
  where y and z are two different column indexes.  Likewise, the right
  product is
      right-prod(x,u) = sum_y N(x,y) N(u,y)
  with x and u being two different row indexes.

  The left-product is the same thing as an entry in the symmetric
  matrix M^TM (with M==LLOBJ and ^T the transpose). That is,
       left-product(y,z) = [M^TM](y,z)
  Likewise, the right-product is an entry in the matrix MM^T.

  Cosines:
  --------
  Similarly, we can define the left and right cosine angles as
      left-cosine(y,z) = left-prod(y,z) /
             (left-length(y) * left-length(z))
  and likewise for the right side. Recall that the left-length is
  defined as
      left-length(y) = sqrt sum_x N(x,y) N(x,y)
                     = sqrt left-prod(y,y)

  Jaccard (Ruzicka):
  ------------------
  The (weighted) Jaccard similarity, also called the Ruzicka similarity,
  is defined as

      left-jacc-sim(a,b) = sum_x min (N(x,a), N(x,b)) /
               sum_x max (N(x,a), N(x,b))

  The (weighted) Jaccard distance is defined as one minus the above.

  The above is not an appropriate distance to use when N is an
  observation count. For example, suppose that N(x,b) was a constant
  multiple of N(x,a). The above formula would judge these two vectors
  as being dis-similar, even though for most applications, scaling by
  a constant would be considered to be irrelevant.

  By default, the value used for N(x,a) is provided by the 'get-count
  method. It can be over-ridden with the GET-COUNT method.

  Note: The API methods return the distance, not the similarity!

  Conditional Jaccard:
  --------------------
  The Jaccard distance gives an awkward result if the two count vectors
  are colinear but of different lengths. For most problems considered
  here, colinear count vectors should be considered to be equal. Thus,
  a normalized version is defined below. The normalization is to use
  the conditional probability instead of the count. (Normalization by
  Euclidean length does not make sense for counts).

  The conditional probability is then defined as
       p(x|a) = N(x,a) / N(*,a)

  The conditional similarity is defined as

      left-cond-jacc-sim(a,b) = sum_x min (p(x|a), p(x|b)) /
               sum_x max (p(x|a), p(x|b))

  The distance is one minus the similarity; the methods return the
  distance, not the similarity!

  Probability Jaccard:
  --------------------
  The above conditional form of the similarity is not quite appropriate
  for true probabilities: it exhibits some discontinuities and
  non-uniformities. The reciprocal of a sum over reciprocals provides
  the ideal, maximally consistent form (according to Wikipedia.)

  The Proability-Jaccard distance can be defined as one minus the
  Probability-Jaccard similarity. The later is defined as

      left-prjacc-sim(a,b) = sum_x
             [sum_y max {N(y,a)/N(x,a), N(y,b)/N(x,b) }]^-1
         = sum_x
             [sum_y max {p(y|a)/p(x|a), p(y|b)/p(x|b) }]^-1

  Note the x sum is a sum over reciprocals of a sum.  This form is
  discussed in greater detail in Wikipedia; it has the advantage of
  providing 'maximally consistent sampling'. Its appropriate for the
  case where the counts really are meant to be interpreted as providing
  probabilistic frequencies.

  The implementation provided here is rather slow, as it does not make
  use of cached values. In particular, is is a LOT slower than any of
  the other methods, especially when the vectors are large.

  The distance is one minus the similarity; the methods return the
  distance, not the similarity!

  Overlap (Jaccard):
  ------------------
  The overlap similarity simply counts how many common non-zero entries
  are shared in common between two rows or columns.  That is, it is

      left-overlap(y,z) = sum_x (0 < N(x,y)) * (0 < N(x,z)) /
               sum_x (0 < N(x,y) + N(x,z))

  It is the same thing as the (unweighted) Jaccard similarity, where each
  point is given exactly the same weight (zero or non-zero). That is,
  the overlap similarity is the same thing as the original, simplest
  definition of the Jaccard distance.

  Arguments:
  ----------
  Here, the LLOBJ is expected to be an object defining a sparse matrix,
  with valid counts associated with each pair. LLOBJ is expected to have
  working, functional methods for 'left-type, 'right-type and 'pair-type
  on it.

  By default, the N(x,y) is taken to be the 'get-count method on LLOBJ,
  i.e. it is literally the count. The optional argument GET-CNT allows
  this to be over-ridden with any other method that returns a number.
  For example, to compute the products and cosines for frequencies, pass
  'pair-freq as the second argument.  Any method that takes a matrix
  element pair and returns a number is allowed.
