; OVERVIEW
; --------
; One of the most common tasks for which the matrices are employed is for
; counting. Rather than requiring each object to implement it's own
; counting API, this file provides some convenience wrappers to get, set
; and increment counts. These can be applied to any objects.
;
; More precisely, we are generally interested in pairs (x,y) of atoms
; (that is, where x and y are atoms), and we have some sort of count
; N(x,y) of how often that particular pair was observed. The objects here
; can be used to define where N(x,y) is stored, and how its updated.
;
; For all of these pairs (x,y), we typically need to get the count
; N(x,y), the partial sums N(x,*) = sum_y N(x,y), and likewise N(*,y)
; and N(*,*).   We need to compute frequencies of observations, such
; as p(x,y) = N(x,y)/N(*,*).  We also need to compute entropies and
; mutual information, which can be inferred from these frequencies.
; We also can compute cosine-similarity and other metrics of similarity,
; derived solely from the observed frequency counts.
;
; All of these formulas are independent of the actual objects in the
; pairs.  Thus, it is useful to separate the various algorithms from
; the data that they operate on. Towards this end, this file defines
; some object-oriented OO API's for pairs, which the algos can assume,
; and the different types of pairs can implement.

(define-public (add-pair-count LLOBJ)
"
  add-pair-count LLOBJ - Extend LLOBJ with methods to get, set and
  increment the counts on pairs.

  The supported methods are:

  'pair-count L R - Returns the total observed count on the pair (L,R)
      L must be an Atom of type 'left-type on the base object LLOBJ,
      and likewise for R. Returns zero if such a pair does not exist.

  'pair-set L R N - Sets the total observed count to N on the pair (L,R).
      Creates the pair, if it does not yet exist.

  'pair-inc L R N - Increments the total observed count by N on the
      pair (L,R).  Creates the pair, if it does not yet exist.

   The next three methods are the same as above, but take the pair
   Atom directly, instead of the two index Atoms.

  'get-count P - Returns the total observed count on the pair P.
      The P atom should be one of the atoms returned by the LLOBJ
      'get-pair method.

  'set-count P N - Set the total observed count to N on the pair P.

  'inc-count P N - Perform an atomic increment of the count on P by N.
       The increment is atomic, meaning that it is thread-safe against
       racing threads.

  'move-count ACC DONOR FRAC - Move a fraction FRAC of the count from
       DONOR to ACC. The move is atomic, in that no counts are lost in
       the case of racing threads performing other count updates.
	    ACC and DONOR should be two pairs in this matrix.
	    FRAC should be a numeric fraction, between 0.0 and 1.0.
