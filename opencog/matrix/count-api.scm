; OVERVIEW
; --------
; One of the most common tasks for which the matrices are employed is for
; counting. Rather than requiring each object to implement it's own
; counting API, this file provides some convenience wrappers to get, set
; and increment counts. These can be applied to any objects.
;
; More precisely, we are generally interested in pairs (x,y) of atoms
; (that is, where x and y are atoms), and we have some sort of count
; N(x,y) of how often that particular pair was observed. The objects here
; can be used to define where N(x,y) is stored, and how its updated.
;
; For all of these pairs (x,y), we typically need to get the count
; N(x,y), the partial sums N(x,*) = sum_y N(x,y), and likewise N(*,y)
; and N(*,*).   We need to compute frequencies of observations, such
; as p(x,y) = N(x,y)/N(*,*).  We also need to compute entropies and
; mutual information, which can be inferred from these frequencies.
; We also can compute cosine-similarity and other metrics of similarity,
; derived solely from the observed frequency counts.
;
; All of these formulas are independent of the actual objects in the
; pairs.  Thus, it is useful to separate the various algorithms from
; the data that they operate on. Towards this end, this file defines
; some object-oriented OO API's for pairs, which the algos can assume,
; and the different types of pairs can implement.
;
; Three API's are provided:
; -- add-count-api, which provides basic counting.
; -- add-storage-count, same as above, but fectches & updates storage.
; -- add-marginal-count, same as above, but updates marginal counts.
; The last two can be combined to safely update marginal counts in storage.
; The storage API should be "below" the marginal API; the marginal API
; will use it to perform the storage.

(define-public (add-count-api LLOBJ)
"
  add-count-api LLOBJ - Extend LLOBJ with default methods to get, set
  and increment the counts on pairs.

  The provided methods are defaults: they are exposed and used only
  if LLOBJ does not already provide them. Otherwise, the methods on
  LLOBJ take precedence.

  The provided methods are all thread-safe.  Counts in attached storage
  are NOT updated; nor are Atoms fetch from storage prior to update.
  Use the `add-storage-count` API to get storage updates.

  The provided methods are:

  'pair-count L R - Returns the total observed count on the pair (L,R)
      L must be an Atom of type 'left-type on the base object LLOBJ,
      and likewise for R. Returns zero if such a pair does not exist.

  'pair-set L R N - Sets the total observed count to N on the pair (L,R).
      Creates the pair, if it does not yet exist.

  'pair-inc L R N - Increments the total observed count by N on the
      pair (L,R).  Creates the pair, if it does not yet exist.

   The above three methods are built on the three below. These do the
   same as above, but take the pair Atom directly, instead of the two
   index Atoms. If LLOBJ already provides the below, then that will
   will be used to implement the above.

  'get-count P - Returns the total observed count on the pair P.
      The P atom should be one of the atoms returned by the LLOBJ
      'get-pair method.

  'set-count P N - Set the total observed count to N on the pair P.

  'inc-count P N - Perform an atomic increment of the count on P by N.
       The increment is atomic, meaning that it is thread-safe against
       racing threads.

  The next method provides an atomic transfer of counts from one
  location to another. It is built on top of the above methods.

  'move-count ACC DONOR FRAC - Move a fraction FRAC of the count from
       DONOR to ACC. The move is atomic, in that no counts are lost in
       the case of racing threads performing other count updates.
       ACC and DONOR should be two pairs in this matrix.
       FRAC should be a numeric fraction, between 0.0 and 1.0.

   The final three methods provide a simplfied API to store values
   in non-standard, custom locations. If LLOBJ provides these methods,
   they will be used to build all of the other methods.

   'count-key - Return the key at which the the count is stored. If the
       base class LLOBJ provides this method, then this key will be used
       for all access. If the base class does not provide this, then the
       default of `(PredicateNode "*-TruthValueKey-*")` is used.

   'count-type - Return the type of the Value holding the count. If the
       base class LLOBJ provides this method, then this type will be used
       when first creating a Value to hold the count. If the base class
       does not provide this, then the default of `CountTruthValue` will
       be used. The count-type should be a subtype of type `FloatValue`,
       as this is the only type capable of holding numbers.

   'count-ref - Return the offset into the vector of the Value holding
       the count. If the base class LLOBJ provides this method, then
       this offset will be used when setting or incrementing the count.
       If the base class does not provide this, then the default of 2
       will be used. This default is the location of the count field on
       `CountTruthValue`'s and is thus backwards-compat with older code.
"
	; By default, the count is stored as a CountTruthValue.
	; That means that it is on the TruthValue Key, and is the
	; third number (the first two being strength and confidence.)
	; These defaults are used if and only if the base object does
	; not provide these.
