; OVERVIEW
; --------
; Given N vectors, one may wish to determine how similar they are to
; one-another. One can, of course, compute pair-wise similarities, but
; there are N!/2 such pairs, and so this gets quickly out of hand.
; Besides, its not clear how to combine pair-wise similarities. Thus,
; it is handy to have similarity measures that work for the entire
; group, taken as a whole.  This file provides that.
;
; Currently, only one function is provided: a generalized Jaccard
; similarity. It is generalized in that it works for N vectors, and not
; just two. It is also generalized by replacing the Jaccard "min"
; function by a "democratic vote" function, where an item is accepted
; if it is shared in commmon by a majority.

  make-group-similarity LLOBJ - Extend LLOBJ with methods to compute
  similarities between rows or columns of the LLOBJ sparse matrix. This
  is a generalization of pair-wise similarity to the case of finding the
  mutual similarity btween three or more rows/columns in the matrix. If
  only pair-wise similarity is needed, use the `add-similarity-compute`
  object.

  Currently, this only provides a generalized Jaccard distance. This
  generalizes the conventional Jaccard distance by preplacing the "min"
  function by a "democratic vote" function, where an item is accepted
  if it is shared in commmon by a majority.

  Some terminology: Let N(x,y) be the observed count for the pair (x,y).
  Let D(x,y) be 1 if N(x,y)>0 and zero otherwise.

  Then, given a set of K columns K={a,b,...,k}, and a single row x,
  let row-supp(x, {a,b,...,k}) = D(x,a) + D(x,b) + ... + D(x,k)
  let row-cnt(x, {a,b,...,k}) = N(x,a) + N(x,b) + ... + N(x,k)
  That is, the row-supp is the total number of columns of the column-set
  that are not zero.  The row-cnt is the sum of all of the counts in
  the column set.

  Given a threshold T, the mutual support of a group of K={a,b,...,k}
  columns is given by

  mutual-row-supp(T,K) = sum_x [T < row-supp(x,K)]

  The mutual overlap (aka the mutual unweighted Jaccard similarity)
  is then
  mutual-row-overlap(T,K) = mutual-row-supp(T,K) / mutual-row-supp(0,K)

  Likewise,
  mutual-row-count(T,K) = sum_x [T < row-cnt(x,K)]

  Note that for K={a,b} just two columns that the conventional overlap
  is given by setting T=1.

  Exchanging rows and columns gives similar definitions.

  Provided methods:
  -----------------
  'row-supp returns the number as defined above. Likewise 'column-supp

  'mutual-row-supp returns a list of two numbers: mutual-row-supp(T,K)
  and mutual-row-supp(0,K). This is because the algo obtains the second
  "for free" while computing the first. It's up to you to divide these,
  if you wish.
