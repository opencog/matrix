(define-public (add-trimmer LLOBJ)

  add-trimmer LLOBJ - Assorted methods for removing matrix entries,
  rows and columns. Removed entries are removed (deleted) from the
  AtomSpace.  If storage is connected, then these are removed from
  storage, too.

  LLOBJ should be an object with the conventional matrix methods on it.

  The methods on this object provide functions that resemble those of
  the `add-generic-filter`, `add-subtotal-filter`, and
  `add-zero-filter`, except that this object simply deletes those atoms,
  instead of filtering them out of the object API. By using the trimmer,
  the total size of the dataset will in general be smaller, and the
  access to the matrix entries will be faster.  This is the primary
  advantage of using the trimmer over use the filters.

  The provided methods are:

  'generic-trim KEEP-LEFT? KEEP-RIGHT? KEEP-ELEMENT?
      Keep Atoms that pass the predicates; otherwise remove (delete)
      them.  If storage is connected, then these are removed from
      storage too.

      KEEP-LEFT? should be a function taking a ROW as an argument;
      it should return #t if that row is to be kept, else it returns #f.

      KEEP-RIGHT? should be a function taking a COL as an argument;
      it should return #t if that column is to be kept, else it
      returns #f.

      KEEP-ELEMENT? should be a function taking a matrix element as an
      argument; it should return #t if that matrix element should be
      kept; else it should return #f.

  'subtotal-trim LEFT-CUT RIGHT-CUT PAIR-CUT
      Remove (delete) Atoms from the AtomSpace whose counts are at or
      below the indicated cutoffs. If storage is connected, then these
      are removed from storage too.

      This method will fail to work correctly, if support marginals
      have not been computed on LLOBJ. That is because the support
      marginals are used to obtain subtotal counts for rows and
      columns. To compute support marginals, say
      `((add-support-compute LLOBJ) 'cache-all)`

      LEFT-CUT should be a number; if the count on that row is equal or
          less than this number, then the entire row (including marginals)
          will be deleted.

      RIGHT-CUT should be a number; if the count on that column is equal
          or less than this number, then the entire row (including
          marginals) will be deleted.

      PAIR-CUT should be a number; if the count on that matrix element
          is equal or less than this number, then that matrix element
          will be deleted.

  'support-trim LEFT-CUT RIGHT-CUT PAIR-CUT
      Almost exactly identical to 'subtotal-trim, except that the cuts
      apply to the size of the support of a column or row, rather than
      to the count.  This is particularly useful when a matrix might
      have only one matrix entry in a given row or column, no matter how
      big the count on that entry may be.

   XXX TODO: This should be designed to call method on the object to
   perform the deletion, instead of calling cog-delete! directly.  This
   would allow the object to handle deletions in a custom fashion.
