(define-public (add-trimmer LLOBJ)
"
  add-trimmer LLOBJ - Assorted methods for removing matrix entries,
  rows and columns. Removed entries are removed (deleted) from the
  AtomSpace.  If storage is connected, then these are removed from
  storage, too.

  LLOBJ should be an object with the conventional matrix methods on it.

  The methods on this object provide functions that resemble those of
  the `add-generic-filter`, `add-subtotal-filter`, and
  `add-zero-filter`, except that this object simply deletes those atoms,
  instead of filtering them out of the object API. By using the trimmer,
  the total size of the dataset will in general be smaller, and the
  access to the matrix entries will be faster.  This is the primary
  advantage of using the trimmer over use the filters.

  The provided methods are:

  'generic-trim LEFT-BASIS-PRED RIGHT-BASIS-PRED ELEMENT-PRED
      Remove (delete) Atoms from the AtomSpace that pass the predicates.
      If storage is connected, then these are removed from storage too.

      LEFT-BASIS-PRED should be a function taking a ROW as an argument;
      it should return #t if that row is to be deleted, else it returns #f.

      RIGHT-BASIS-PRED should be a function taking a COL as an argument;
      it should return #t if that column is to be deleted, else it
      returns #f.

      ELEMENT-PRED should be a function taking a matrix element as an
      argument; it should return #t if that matrix element should be
      deleted, else it should return #f.

  subtotal-trim LLOBJ LEFT-CUT RIGHT-CUT PAIR-CUT
  Remove (delete) Atoms from the AtomSpace whose counts are at or below
  the indicated cutoffs. If storage is connected, then these are removed
  from storage too.

  This function will fail to work correctly, if support marginals have
  not been computed on LLOBJ. That is because the support marginals are
  used to obtain subtotal counts for rows and columns.  To compute
  support marginals, say `((add-support-compute LLOBJ) 'cache-all)`

  LLOBJ should be an object with the conventional matrix methods on it.

  LEFT-CUT should be a number; if the count on that row is equal or less
      than this number, then the entire row (including marginals) will
      be deleted.
